# Binary Tree Formatter (Rust)

Prints out a binary tree with formatting. This branch reimplements the program in Rust with the help of [Jaxydog](https://github.com/Jaxydog).

Written and tested with Rust 1.76 on Ubuntu 20.04 & 22.04. It may work on other versions, but there is no guarantee.

*Binary Tree Formatter is work in progress software. **Use at your own risk!***

## Usage

$ cargo run
```

## Expected Output
